# BlackShot Server Emulator

A Work-In-Progress server emulator for BlackShot, An MMOFPS developed by VertigoGames. Inc

### BackStory
Out of both curiosity and nostalgia for this game and mainly the old client since the devs ruined it and made it the Pay2Win meme it is from 2015 until now, I've decided to bring those days back and this project does just that though not complete and a lot of things are not fully working while other things need to be implemented.

### How Can I Help
This project is open for both curious people that want to see how things are ran behind the scenes of the official server(to a very close degree) but also for people that know how to reverse engineer and are willing to help improve the project through code improvements and unvailing packet structures etc..
